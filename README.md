## Minesweeper
 In this code a screenshot is taken at place x,y of width, height. You will need to change these variables. The AI looks at each cell and looks for the color of the numbers.

 The AI will go and look if there are the same amount of green sqaures and flags around the cell as the number in it, at that the AI adds the location of the green sqaures around to a list that needs to be right clicked.
 If there are the same amount of flags around a cell as the number, the location of all green sqaures around will be added to a list witch will be left clicked.

 This is not the final product, it can not yet comlepete the hardest level of google minesweeper.
